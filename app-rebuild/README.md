# MEME Launchpad Backend Rebuild

This is an isolated, step-by-step rebuild of the backend in the sibling
`apps/api` and `apps/indexer` directories. It intentionally starts small:
each step must run and be understandable before the next responsibility is
introduced.

The original backend is not imported or modified by this project.

## Learning path

- [x] Step 1 — runnable HTTP foundation and health endpoint
- [x] Step 2 — configuration and application dependencies
- [x] Step 3 — PostgreSQL connection and first `users` repository
- [x] Step 4 — wallet-signature login and JWT authentication
- [ ] Step 5 — token read APIs and database models
- [ ] Step 6 — token-creation intent, CREATE2 prediction, and signing
- [ ] Step 7 — separate blockchain event indexer
- [ ] Step 8 — event projections for tokens, trades, and K-lines
- [ ] Step 9 — Redis nonce cache and presigned image uploads

## Step 1: run the foundation

```bash
cd app-rebuild
go test ./...
HTTP_PORT=38081 go run ./cmd/api
```

In another terminal:

```bash
curl http://localhost:38081/healthz
```

Expected response:

```json
{"service":"meme-launchpad-rebuild-api","status":"ok"}
```

At this checkpoint, there is no database, wallet login, blockchain RPC, or
Redis. The only responsibility is starting and stopping a predictable HTTP
process.

## Step 2: explicit configuration and application wiring

`cmd/api/main.go` is now only the process lifecycle owner: it loads
configuration, creates the application, starts HTTP, and handles shutdown.

`internal/config` reads and validates configuration without using global state:

| Environment variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_NAME` | `meme-launchpad-rebuild-api` | Name returned by `/healthz` and used in logs |
| `HTTP_PORT` | `38081` | HTTP port; must be from 1 through 65535 |

`internal/app` is the dependency container. It currently wires the configured
service name into the HTTP handler. In Step 3 it will also own the PostgreSQL
pool, so handlers do not construct connections for themselves.

Try the configuration boundary:

```bash
APP_NAME=my-local-api HTTP_PORT=48080 go run ./cmd/api
curl http://localhost:48080/healthz
```

The expected response now contains `my-local-api`.

## Step 3: PostgreSQL and the first repository

Step 3 adds a single PostgreSQL pool for the process. `internal/app` creates
it once, injects it into `UserRepository`, and closes it during shutdown. A
handler never creates a database connection itself.

Set `DATABASE_URL` to a PostgreSQL connection string. Its safe local default
is `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/meme_launchpad?sslmode=disable`.
Create the `users` table before starting the API:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/meme_launchpad?sslmode=disable'
createdb meme_launchpad
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f migrations/001_create_users.sql
go run ./cmd/api
```

`UserRepository` currently contains only two operations: `FindByAddress` and
`Create`. Step 4 will call them after verifying a wallet signature, so this
step intentionally exposes no user HTTP endpoint yet.

## Step 4: wallet login and JWT authentication

The login flow is now runnable: request a one-time message, sign it in the
wallet, then send its signature to `POST /api/v1/user/wallet-login`. The server
generates an EIP-4361 Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) message, validates the
stored challenge's domain, URI, version, chain ID, address, nonce, issue time,
and expiry, recovers the Ethereum address from the ERC-191 personal-signature,
consumes the nonce after successful verification, finds or creates the user,
and returns a 24-hour JWT.
`GET /api/v1/user/me` requires that token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

The SIWE message binds a login to the domain, request URI, BSC Testnet chain
ID, random nonce, issued time, and expiry. Configure those relying-party values
for your deployment:

| Environment variable | Local default |
| --- | --- |
| `SIWE_DOMAIN` | `localhost:38081` |
| `SIWE_URI` | `http://localhost:38081` |
| `SIWE_CHAIN_ID` | `97` |

Set `JWT_SECRET` outside local development. The in-memory nonce store is only
for this checkpoint; restarting the API invalidates outstanding messages.
Step 9 will replace it with Redis so authentication works across processes.
This checkpoint verifies externally owned accounts (EOAs); contract-wallet
signatures require ERC-1271 verification, which is outside the current scope.
It verifies a server-issued challenge, not an arbitrary SIWE message submitted
by a client; the latter would also require an ABNF-compliant SIWE parser.
